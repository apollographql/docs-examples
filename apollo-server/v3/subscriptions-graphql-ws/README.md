# Subscriptions in Apollo Server v3

This example demonstrates a basic subscription operation in Apollo Server.
[See the docs on subscriptions](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/data/subscriptions/)

The example server exposes one subscription (`numberIncremented`) that returns
an integer that's incremented on the server every second.

After you start up this server, you can test out running a subscription with the
Apollo Studio Explorer by following the link from http://localhost:4000/graphql
to the Apollo Sandbox. You may need to edit the Apollo Sandbox connection
settings to select the
[`graphql-ws` subscriptions implementation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/explorer/additional-features/#subscription-support).
You'll see the subscription's value update every second.

```graphql
subscription IncrementingNumber {
  numberIncremented
}
```

## Run locally

```shell
npm install
npm start
```

## Run in CodeSandbox
