# Getting started with Apollo Gateway v2

This is the complete code from [Implementing a gateway with Apollo Server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/using-federation/apollo-gateway-setup).

## Run locally

```shell
npm install
npm start
```

### Supergraph Schema
The [supergraph schema file is static](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/using-federation/apollo-gateway-setup#composing-the-supergraph-schema) and fetched from the [Router example schema](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/quickstart#2-download-the-example-supergraph-schema).

See [our docs](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/using-federation/apollo-gateway-setup#nodejs-gateway-setup) on how to provide a supergraph with other methods.
